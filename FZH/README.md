ZenHub is a kanban board where the user stories are [GitHub issues](https://github.com/Regalis11/Barotrauma/issues). Due to the fact that it's a kanban board, it's a gigantic waste of my time. Since I need to use it anyway, this tool hopes to make my life a little easier. If nothing else, making this and using it will be more fun than interacting with ZenHub directly.
